# Waypoint Guest App

This repo is a public example of what an app could look like on a more
opinionated theoretical Waypoint hosting platform.

It is intentionally small, but it exercises the important pieces:

- TanStack Start public web app.
- Hono API Worker.
- internal Worker reached only through a Worker-to-Worker binding.
- Better Auth mounted on the API Worker.
- Better Auth anonymous sessions for guest access.
- D1 through `ctx.db`.
- typed API client calls from a type-only contract export.
- local dev through `bun way dev <app>`.

The goal is not to be a product template yet. It is a working reference app for
the desired developer experience: app code declares intent, Waypoint handles the
Cloudflare wiring, auth, bindings, and local URLs, and frontend code calls the
API through typed functions.

Waypoint's broader motivation is to make production safer for humans and agents:
agents should be able to inspect events, logs, deploys, resource state, and
environment differences without broad destructive credentials. The same model
should eventually support agency client hosting, where deploys, backups,
observability, and environment management become a reliable hosting upcharge
instead of one-off infrastructure work.

## Apps

```text
apps/web       TanStack Start frontend
apps/api       public API Worker
apps/internal  internal Worker RPC service
```

The web app imports only the API contract type:

```ts
import type { ApiContract } from "../../api/src/contract";
```

That keeps the frontend client type-safe without importing API runtime code.

## Auth

The API mounts Better Auth at `/auth/*`:

```ts
export default api.worker(contract, {
  authHandler: (ctx) => ctx.auth,
});
```

The public route can create an anonymous Better Auth session. The protected
`/workspace` route uses TanStack Router `beforeLoad` to create or reuse that
anonymous session before rendering, then calls the protected `api.me` query.

That means guest mode is real auth, not a fake local flag. The browser receives
a Better Auth anonymous session cookie, the API reads it through middleware, and
the typed client can call protected queries without importing API runtime code.

## Control Plane Direction

The platform repo now exposes the first control-plane shape:

```sh
bun way inspect --json
bun way plan
bun way submit --control-plane https://waypoint-control.example.com
bun way deploy api --dry-run
```

`bun way plan` is the agent-readable dry run for this project only. `bun way
submit` sends this app's intent to the control plane without deploying. The
local deploy bridge can still use generated Wrangler config for development and
escape hatches, but production deploys should normally run through generated
GitHub Actions on Blacksmith after typecheck/test/build gates.

The intended final path is manifest plus artifact upload to a central
control-plane Worker, which reconciles Cloudflare resources, records deploy
state, manages environment variables and bindings, and gives agents audited read
access to production diagnostics.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

Run individual services:

```sh
bun way dev internal
bun way dev api
bun way dev web
```

Or start the dev CLI session from this repo with the configured `dev.json`.

## Checks

```sh
bun run check-types
```

The API Worker bootstraps the small local D1 schema used by this example so the
anonymous-auth flow works immediately in local development. A real Waypoint
control plane should replace that with managed migrations.
